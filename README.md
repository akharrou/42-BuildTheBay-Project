# 42-Hackathon-BuildTheBay

Build the Bay is a week-long hackathon that was hosted here at [42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/) that was designed to help make a difference in the Bay Area community. The focus is to use tech to help a local cause. This includes helping local nonprofits, charities, or family-owned local businesses. Anne Stedler, Economic Development Manager for the city of Newark, and Felix Lawrence, a local restaurant marketing partner, attended the event.
